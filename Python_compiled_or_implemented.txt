Answer is both

Compiler converts source into target language, i.e. high level language to machine language,
almost it can do any conversion like it can also convert from one high level language to another high level language

Interpreter converts into target code by reading source code, line by line


conversion process in python = source code <compiler> byte code <interpreter(by python virtual machine)> machine language


Reason
-concept of bytecode is used for ,portability i.e. write once run anywhere
-compiling code on one machine may not work on another machine because of different cpu architecture
- to solve this problem we use virtual machine
-in virtual machine we run bytecode and that will be converted into machine code
-so, virtual machine software or VM software is required to run python code
-Virtual machine for python = PVM(Python Virtual Machine)
